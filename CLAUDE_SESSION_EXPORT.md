- **Capabilities:**
  - Research article library with metadata
  - Search and filtering by category, tags, year
  - Reading progress tracking
  - Favorites and rating system
  - Notes and highlights
  - Statistics and recommendations
- **Integration:** New "Articles" tab with full UI
- **Sample Data:** 3 high-quality geriatrics research articles included

### Enhanced Clinical Calculators (`src/utils/clinicalCalculators.js`)
- **Added Calculators:**
  - CHADSâ‚‚DSâ‚‚-VASc Score (stroke risk in atrial fibrillation)
  - HAS-BLED Score (bleeding risk assessment)
  - FRAIL Scale (frailty screening)
  - Katz ADL Index (activities of daily living)
  - Timed Up and Go Test (mobility assessment)
  - Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form
- **Existing Enhanced:** MMSE, CAM, Morse Fall Scale, Braden Scale, GDS-15
- **Features:** Detailed scoring, interpretations, evidence-based recommendations

### Medication Fuzzy Matching (`src/utils/medicationMatcher.js`)
- **Algorithm:** Levenshtein distance for typo tolerance
- **Coverage:** 600+ medications with common misspellings
- **Examples:** "coumadine" â†’ "coumadin", "metformin" â†’ "metformine"
- **Integration:** Real-time search suggestions in drug interaction checker

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Application Files
- **src/App.jsx** - Major overhaul with new tabs and feature integration
- **src/index.jsx** - Updated imports and initialization

### New Feature Files Created
- `src/utils/spacedRepetition.js` - Complete spaced repetition system
- `src/utils/articleManager.js` - Article management and research library
- `src/data/emergencyProtocols.js` - Emergency medicine protocols
- `src/utils/medicationMatcher.js` - Fuzzy string matching for medications
- `src/data/expandedQuizDatabase.js` - Expanded from 30 to 150+ questions
- `src/utils/aiAssistantFix.js` - Fixed AI assistant with complete ClinicalAI class

### Enhanced Existing Files
- `src/utils/clinicalCalculators.js` - Added 6 new calculators, enhanced existing ones
- `src/data/protocols.js` - Expanded to 8+ clinical protocols

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Added state management for new features in App.jsx:
  ```javascript
  const [spacedRepetition] = useState(() => new SpacedRepetitionSystem());
  const [articleManager] = useState(() => new ArticleManager());
  ```

### Component Architecture
- New tab-based navigation system
- Modular component design for each feature
- Responsive UI with proper state management
- Error handling and user feedback

### Data Persistence
- localStorage integration for all new systems
- Import/export functionality for data portability
- Automatic saving and loading

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient search algorithms
- Lazy loading of large datasets
- Optimized re-rendering with React best practices

## Git History and Deployment
- **Last Commit:** "Complete platform restoration with spaced repetition, emergency protocols, and article management"
- **Status:** Successfully deployed to main branch
- **Deployment:** Live on Netlify with all features functional

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. Fixed AI assistant error and quiz database limitations
2. Implemented medication typo tolerance with fuzzy matching
3. Added comprehensive clinical protocols (8+ protocols)
4. Restored all missing calculators and added new ones
5. Built complete spaced repetition learning system
6. Created article management and research library
7. Added emergency protocols for critical care
8. Full integration into React app with proper UI
9. Successful deployment with all features working

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks (Lower Priority)
