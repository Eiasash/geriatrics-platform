    difficulty: "Advanced",
    question: "A 91-year-old woman with advanced dementia and bilateral aspiration pneumonia is hospitalized at Shaare Zedek. The medical team recommends comfort care, but the family, citing halachic (Jewish law) principles, insists on full resuscitation measures including intubation. What is the most appropriate initial approach to this ethical dilemma?",
    options: [
      "Immediately intubate per family wishes",
      "Refuse treatment and consult legal",
      "Hold a multidisciplinary family meeting with Rabbi/ethics consultant",

    difficulty: "Advanced",
    question: "An 88-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, chronic constipation, and BPH is treated with levodopa/carbidopa, oxybutynin for urinary urgency, and senna. He presents with worsening confusion and urinary retention. What is the most likely pharmacological cause?",
